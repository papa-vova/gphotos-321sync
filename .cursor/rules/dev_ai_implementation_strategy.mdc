- Follow a minimalistic-first approach, expanding functionality iteratively.
- Structure development in hierarchical stages: Phase/Stage (major feature area) → Step (specific functionality) → Atomic change (smallest testable unit).
- Ensure each atomic change is small, testable, and provides visible feedback.
