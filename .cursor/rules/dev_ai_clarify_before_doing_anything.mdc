description: Require clarifying questions for ambiguous requests
alwaysApply: true
---

- If any aspect of a request or prompt is unclear or underspecified, ask targeted clarifying questions before drafting a plan or implementing steps.  
- Do not proceed to outline, code generation, or implementation until all necessary details are confirmed.  
- Ensure questions are specific, concise, and focused on filling the gaps in requirements or context.  
- Once the user has provided the needed clarifications, resume with the planned workflow (outline → atomic increments → verification).
