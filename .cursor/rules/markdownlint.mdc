## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Block Standards

- Use `text` for plain text examples
- Use `python` for Python code
- Use `json` for JSON examples
- Use `bash` for shell commands
- Use `yaml` for YAML configuration

### List Formatting

- Use consistent bullet points (`-` or `*`)
- Maintain proper indentation for nested lists
- Add blank lines before and after all lists

### Heading Structure

- Use proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Add blank lines before and after all headings
- Maintain consistent heading formatting

### File Endings

- Always end files with exactly one newline character
- No trailing whitespace
- Consistent line endings (LF preferred)

## Enforcement
