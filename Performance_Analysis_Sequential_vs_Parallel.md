## Key Insights

### When Sequential Makes Sense

- **Tiny libraries** (<100 files): Overhead dominates, sequential is simpler
- **Memory-constrained environments**: <1 GB RAM available
- **Debugging**: Simpler to reason about and debug

### When Parallel Makes Sense

- **Any library >1,000 files**: Speedup justifies complexity
- **Large libraries**: Time savings are massive (hours)
- **Modern hardware**: 8+ cores, 8+ GB RAM (typical today)
- **Production use**: Worth the implementation complexity

### Bottleneck Analysis

**Sequential:**

- Bottleneck: Everything is sequential, no parallelism
- Limited by: Sum of all operation times

**Parallel:**

- Bottleneck: I/O bandwidth (disk read speed)
- CPU work happens in parallel while waiting for I/O
- Effective speedup: ~6-7x (not 8x due to I/O limits)

### Optimization Opportunities

**Sequential:**

- Minimal - already simple
- Could batch DB writes (small gain)

**Parallel:**

- Tune N (worker threads) based on I/O concurrency
- Tune M (worker processes) based on CPU cores
- Adjust batch size for DB writes
- Could achieve 7-8x speedup with tuning

## Implementation Details

### Thread vs Process: What They Are

**Thread:**

- Lightweight execution unit that runs **inside** a Python process
- Shares memory with other threads in the same process
- Can access the same variables, queues, database connections
- Limited by Python's GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) for CPU work
- Created with: `threading.Thread(target=function)`

**Process:**

- Completely separate Python interpreter with its own memory
- Cannot directly access variables from other processes
- Must communicate via serialization (pickle data, send, receive)
- NOT limited by GIL - can do true parallel CPU work
- Created with: `multiprocessing.Process()` or `multiprocessing.Pool()`

### Orchestrator Responsibilities

#### At Startup

```python
import threading
import multiprocessing
import queue

# 1. Create Process Pool (M separate Python processes start up)
process_pool = multiprocessing.Pool(processes=M)  # ~200ms for M=8

# 2. Create queues (shared between threads in main process)
work_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)
results_queue = queue.Queue(maxsize=1000)

# 3. Start Worker Threads (N threads in main process)
worker_threads = []
for i in range(N):
    t = threading.Thread(
        target=worker_function, 
        args=(work_queue, results_queue, process_pool)
    )
    t.start()
    worker_threads.append(t)

# 4. Start Batch Writer Thread
writer_thread = threading.Thread(
    target=writer_function, 
    args=(results_queue, db)
)
writer_thread.start()

# 5. Walk filesystem and populate work_queue
for file in walk_filesystem():
    work_queue.put(file)
```

**Cost:** ~216 ms (one-time)

#### During Execution

The orchestrator **waits** - all work happens in threads and processes:

- **Worker Threads**: Pull from work_queue, call process_pool, put in results_queue
- **Process Pool**: Handles CPU work when called
- **Writer Thread**: Pulls from results_queue, writes to DB

**Cost:** 0 (orchestrator is idle)

#### At Shutdown

```python
# 1. Signal workers to stop
for i in range(N):
    work_queue.put(None)

# 2. Wait for worker threads
for t in worker_threads:
    t.join()

# 3. Signal writer to stop
results_queue.put(None)
writer_thread.join()

# 4. Shutdown process pool
process_pool.close()
process_pool.join()
```

**Cost:** ~66 ms (one-time)

## Recommendation

**Use parallel architecture for any library >1,000 files.**

**Rationale:**

- 6-7x speedup on realistic workloads
- Memory cost (736 MB) is acceptable on modern systems
- Startup/shutdown overhead becomes negligible at scale
- Time savings are substantial (minutes to hours)

**Configuration:**

- N = 2-4x CPU cores for worker threads (e.g., 16-32 for 8-core CPU)
  - Threads do I/O work and block waiting, so oversubscribe
- M = CPU cores for process pool (e.g., 8 for 8-core CPU)
  - Processes do CPU work, match core count for true parallelism
- Batch size = 100-500 (tune based on DB performance)

**Trade-offs accepted:**

- 10x memory usage (70 MB → 736 MB)
- Implementation complexity
- Startup/shutdown overhead (~282 ms total)

## Appendix: Threads vs Processes Deep Dive

### What Are Threads and Processes?

#### Thread

A **thread** is a lightweight execution unit that runs **inside** a Python process.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Shared memory**: All threads in a process share the same memory space
- **Direct access**: Can directly access the same variables, queues, and database connections
- **Low overhead**: Creating a thread takes ~1-5 ms
- **Memory cost**: ~2 MB per thread
- **GIL limitation**: Python's Global Interpreter Lock prevents true parallel CPU execution
- **Best for**: I/O-bound work (reading files, network requests, database queries)
- **Created with**: `threading.Thread(target=function)`

**Why threads work for I/O:**
When a thread does I/O (like reading a file), Python releases the GIL, allowing other threads to run. This means multiple threads can wait for I/O simultaneously.

#### Process

A **process** is a completely separate Python interpreter with its own memory space.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Isolated memory**: Each process has its own memory, cannot access other processes' variables
- **Communication overhead**: Must serialize (pickle) data to send between processes
- **High overhead**: Creating a process takes ~25-50 ms
- **Memory cost**: ~80 MB per process (full Python interpreter)
- **No GIL limitation**: Each process has its own GIL, enabling true parallel CPU execution
- **Best for**: CPU-bound work (hashing, compression, parsing, computation)
- **Created with**: `multiprocessing.Process()` or `multiprocessing.Pool()`

**Why processes work for CPU:**
Each process has its own Python interpreter and GIL. CPU-intensive work in one process doesn't block other processes, achieving true parallelism on multi-core CPUs.

                  IPC (Inter-Process Communication)
                  Data must be serialized (pickled)
```

### Why Use Both?

Our architecture uses **threads for I/O coordination** and **processes for CPU work**:

```text
Main Process (Threads):
├─ Orchestrator Thread: Manages lifecycle
├─ Worker Thread 1: Read file → Send to process → Wait → Write result
├─ Worker Thread 2: Read file → Send to process → Wait → Write result
├─ Worker Thread N: Read file → Send to process → Wait → Write result
└─ Writer Thread: Batch write to database

Process Pool (Processes):
├─ Process 1: EXIF extraction, CRC32 hashing, MIME detection
├─ Process 2: EXIF extraction, CRC32 hashing, MIME detection
└─ Process M: EXIF extraction, CRC32 hashing, MIME detection
```

**The workflow:**

1. **Worker Thread** (I/O): Reads JSON file from disk (releases GIL)
2. **Worker Thread** (coordination): Submits file path to Process Pool
3. **Process** (CPU): Does heavy computation (EXIF, CRC32, MIME) in parallel
4. **Worker Thread** (I/O): Receives result, puts in results queue
5. **Writer Thread** (I/O): Batch writes to database (releases GIL)

### Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | Thread | Process |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Creation time** | 1-5 ms | 25-50 ms |
| **Memory per unit** | ~2 MB | ~80 MB |
| **Startup cost (N=16)** | ~5 ms | - |
| **Startup cost (M=8)** | - | ~200 ms |
| **Communication** | Direct (shared memory) | Serialization (pickle) |
| **Parallelism** | No (GIL blocks CPU) | Yes (separate GIL) |
| **Use case** | I/O-bound | CPU-bound |

### Configuration Rules

**Worker Threads (N):**

- **Rule**: 2-4x CPU cores
- **Reason**: Threads block on I/O, so oversubscribe to keep CPU busy
- **Example**: 16-32 threads for 8-core CPU
- **Cost**: 16 × 2 MB = 32 MB

**Worker Processes (M):**

- **Rule**: Match CPU cores
- **Reason**: CPU-bound work, more processes = contention
- **Example**: 8 processes for 8-core CPU
- **Cost**: 8 × 80 MB = 640 MB

### Worker Thread Example

```python
def worker_function(work_queue, results_queue, process_pool):
    """Worker thread that coordinates I/O and CPU work"""
    while True:
        # 1. Get work (I/O-bound, thread is fine)
        work_item = work_queue.get()
        if work_item is None:  # Sentinel
            break
        
        # 2. Parse JSON (I/O-bound, thread is fine)
        json_data = parse_json(work_item.json_file)
        
        # 3. Submit CPU work to process pool
        future = process_pool.apply_async(
            cpu_intensive_work,  # This runs in a separate process
            args=(work_item.file_path,)
        )
        
        # 4. Wait for result (thread blocks, but that's OK)
        cpu_result = future.get()  # Blocks until process returns
        
        # 5. Combine results and put in results queue
        combined = {**json_data, **cpu_result}
        results_queue.put(combined)

def cpu_intensive_work(file_path):
    """This runs in a separate process"""
    exif = extract_exif(file_path)  # CPU-intensive
    crc32 = calculate_crc32(file_path)  # CPU-intensive
    mime = detect_mime(file_path)  # CPU-intensive
    return {'exif': exif, 'crc32': crc32, 'mime': mime}
```
